Good evening, America. Welcome back to the show. Tonight, we're talking about something that's truly
emblematic of the decline of American sports: the proposed implementation of a pitching clock in Major
League Baseball. Yes, you heard that right. A pitching clock. It's like they're trying to suck every
ounce of joy out of America's pastime.

You know, Major League Baseball used to be about strategy, skill, and tradition. But now, some brainiacs
in the front office want to turn it into a glorified game of musical chairs. They want to rush the pitchers,
force them to throw within a certain time limit. It's absurd!

Let me tell you something: baseball is meant to be savored. It's not a race against the clock. It's a timeless
sport where every pitch, every moment, matters. But these so-called "innovators" think they know better.
They want to speed up the game, make it more appealing to the ADHD generation.

Look at this. Is this what we want baseball to become? A sport dictated by a ticking clock? It's madness!
And for what? So some executive can squeeze in a few more commercial breaks? So they can sell more advertising
space? Is that what it's come to?

You know, there used to be a time when baseball was pure. When it wasn't about money or ratings. It was about
the love of the game. But now, it seems like everything's up for grabs. They'll change the rules, tweak the
traditions, all in the name of progress. Well, I say enough is enough!

So to the powers that be in Major League Baseball, I have a message for you: Leave our game alone! Stop trying
to fix what isn't broken. Let baseball be baseball. Because if you keep messing with it, pretty soon, there won't
be anything left worth watching.
